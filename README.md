# 🧠 Sysmon-to-Splunk: Reverse Shell Attack Detection

> **Stack:** VirtualBox, Kali Linux (attacker), Ubuntu (target), Sysmon-for-Linux, Splunk  
> **Focus:** Endpoint Telemetry - SIEM Integration - Threat Detection
> **Goal:** Build and analyze a real attack scenario using Sysmon for Linux and Splunk SIEM


## 🔍 Overview

This lab simulates a **realistic endpoint compromise** in a controlled environment.  
Using **Kali Linux** as the attacker and **Ubuntu** as the target, I generated and analyzed **Sysmon telemetry** to detect malicious activity through **Splunk SIEM**.

The project bridges **red-team tactics** and **blue-team analysis** — showing how attacker actions translate into logs, and how defenders can identify those behaviors.
